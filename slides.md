Note:
Back in 2008 when I worked as a system administrator I needed a way to organize my work...
Somehow I realised that what I need called "time management"...
...And since I was a sysadmin I added "for system administrators" to my query.
...And - surprise!

Note:
This was The book that made me know about issue tracking software.
Software it mentioned was Request Tracker - ticketing system by Best Practical solutions.

## Request Tracker

### ...or simply RT

Note:
I've installed it in the organization I worked at and we used it with my colleauge quite successfully.
I played with it and set it up.
But then times changed and I've become a Perl programmer and forgot about RT for ages...
...until I found a contract from one of Moscow ISPs who wanted to improve RT to work with their customer's data.
